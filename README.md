*** Updated 01-08-18 ***

D3.js is a JavaScript based library used for creating dynamic data displays.  RedFlare is designed to add basic bar charts, pie charts to existing content.  Just the core code to get a decent looking chart into your HTML page


## First Use Case ##
Build easy to use code that will place more than one d3 graph (Bar and line) onto a HTML page with other content.

Requirements:
Data is easy to add in an external JSON file.
Handle adding too much data gracefully.
